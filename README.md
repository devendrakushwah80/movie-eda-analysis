# 🎬 Movie Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a movie dataset to understand patterns, trends, and relationships between different movie attributes such as ratings, popularity, genres, and revenue.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and answer basic analytical questions related to movie performance and audience preferences.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the movie dataset
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analyze relationships between numerical and categorical variables
- Visualize trends and patterns in movies data
- Derive insights that can help in recommendation or decision-making

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-EDA.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Movie-EDA


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook EDA_Movie.ipynb

📌 Insights & Findings

Certain genres consistently receive higher ratings

Popularity does not always guarantee high revenue

Ratings show moderate correlation with audience engagement

Data-driven patterns can support recommendation systems

📎 Future Improvements

Add predictive modeling (rating or revenue prediction)

Integrate recommendation system logic

Perform time-based trend analysis

Use interactive visualizations (Plotly)
